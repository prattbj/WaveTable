# Wavetable
## A bare-bones wavetable synthesizer

This is the source code for a functioning wavetable synthesiser that turns a WAV file into a 256 frame, 2048 samples per frame, band-limited wavetable. 

### What's next?

I'll be adding some more parameters, like unison voices, phase, pitch, and pan, and then maybe (hopefully) some morphing effects later on. 

This will then be added to my big synthesizer project as a piece of a bigger creation.
