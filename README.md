# Wavetable
## A bare-bones wavetable synthesizer

This is the source code for a functioning wavetable synthesiser that turns a WAV file into a 256 frame, 2048 samples per frame, band-limited wavetable.

### What's next?

Currently, I am working on an LFO that can modulate parameters like Gain or Frame #. It currently doesn't function and sometimes causes the program to crash.

I'll be adding some more parameters, like unison voices, phase, pitch, and pan, and then maybe (hopefully) some morphing effects later on. 

I also have plans to add ways to create your own wavetables with a GUI that lets you change individual harmonics' phase and amplitude values.

This will then be added to my big synthesizer project as a piece of a bigger creation.
